This is my Hello World - About and Readme

About me - 
  I've been working as a super user and product manager for a couple of years in Norwegian public sector.
  My main fields of study at University was History of Religion (M. Phil) and Arabic Language and History (secondary BA),
  but I also spent some time studying Python 2 as a part of my Math, Econ and Informatics course of 1 year.
  
  Sort of fell in love with systematic analysis, problem solving and logic, hence my proclivity towards single-focus methods as a product manager.
  
  I combine my role as product manager with that of QA/test-engineer, which has put me in a peculiar spot: Being sort-of DevOps without being able to write my own code.
  
  So - I rehashed my superjunior Python skills - Now updated to Python 3 (sweet) - and started coding my own small automations, syncs and API-requests.
  
  Most of my work is not suitable for sharing due to GDPR as well as me not being absolutely on par with the regimes of open source policies, but -
  I will commit my own private journey through Python3-land in #groundControl to document it.
  
    ...Might be in order to have some notes while I fumble around with classes, inheritance and brute-force-code.
  
  And who knows - Maybe an actual portfolio evolves?
